I"E<p>As of today, January 13th, 2020 I officially completed the code to my very first project at Flatiron School. While I can finally exhale a sigh of relief I am not afraid to admit at the beginning of this project I was completely lost and was aimlessly trying to begin somewhere. Like Avi said in one of his video lectures “A programmers worst nightmare is a blank screen.” I cand definitely attest to that and felt that exact feeling when I first set off to complete this project. For the first time and definitely not the last I felt my fair share of imposter syndrome.</p>
