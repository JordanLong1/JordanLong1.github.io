As of today, January 13th, 2020 I officially completed the code to my very first project at Flatiron School. While I can finally exhale a sigh of relief I am not afraid to admit at the beginning of this project I was completely lost and was aimlessly trying to begin somewhere. Like Avi said in one of his video lectures "A programmers worst nightmare is a blank screen." I cand definitely attest to that and felt that exact feeling when I first set off to complete this project. For the first time and definitely not the last I felt my fair share of imposter syndrome. 

Our task was to create a CLI data gem from scratch either using an API, or scraping a website and getting that data and using it in our application. I at first attempted the API but ultimately ended up scraping a website for concert and other event information in my surrounding area where I'm from, calling it EventFinder.

The amount of information I've learned up to this point in the course is astonishing and the amount that I learned in the process of making this project is even more mindblowing. For the first time ever coding from scratch I used gems, I scraped data for the first time in a project, wrote methods, classes, class methods, instance methods and making them all collaborate together and talk to each other. Seeing it work all together for the first time was easily the best feeling I've had so far in this course, it made the sturggle at the beginning worth it. 

Throughout this process of accomplishing all of these things into one project I must say I couldn't of done it without an extremely helpful support system(my lead, ed coach, and cohort mates especially the squad!)
