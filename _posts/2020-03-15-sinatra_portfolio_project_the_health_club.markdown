The amount I learned during the two week course of this project was crazy to me. I never notice how much I learn on a week to week basic of doing lessons in the curriculum until I get to the project and put it all together. For our sinatra project the task at hand was to create am MVC project (model, view, controller).  I decided to do mine on a workout tracker called "The Health Club" inspired by the name of the gym I first started working out at in my small hometown. 

 One thing I struggled with the most during the project was getting the current user of the account to be view and delete and do certain things to their account and or workouts. During that process imposter syndrome hit me like a car and i started thinking all of the negative thoughts, I preservered and of course have some wonderful cohort mates that helped me get through it and maintain positivity. Also during this project I learned a lot about using css and html to help make things look a lot nicer. I was introduced to a Nav bar, coloring the backrounds and certain features, and even uploading a picture as a backround at one point.
 
 One thing that I think I felt really comfortable with was working with was working with the views part and getting the basic things in order before going onto making it look better. I got my workouts controller views done within a day of just the basic things needed to display which made me feel good about where I was at. 
 
 To clairify the MVC from my first paragraph hear is a one sentence summary of what it means:

M(odel) : Structures your data in a reliable form and prepares it based on controller’s instructions. The logic behind the scenes of what is seen.
V(iew) :  Displays data to user in easy-to-understand format, based on the user’s actions. Pretty much the interface of the logic.
C(ontroller) :  Takes in user commands, sends commands to the model for data updates, sends instructions to view to update interface. Kind of like a waiter in a restaurant being the middle man from the customers order then back to the kitchen  to the chef and back in forth.
